# MovieApp

This app was made for training purposes. It was created to learn **Kotlin** language and some of popular Android frameworks and libraries. 

Due to its training purpose application could evolve in future.

# How it works

Application is basically a simple REST client for [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API.

Before first launch, a special API key should be provided. It can be placed in a file *key.txt* in the project's main directory. During building process it will be copied in the app's resources.

The key is private, so it should not be shared publicly. More information about the key and how to receive it under link: [TMDb developers](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started)
